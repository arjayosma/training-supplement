# Training Supplement

This README contains Web development related training supplements. This can help augment your knowledge in web development.

## Web Development

Creating web pages is very fun and exciting because it gives you the sense of instant gratification.

You just have to pop and open your favorite text editor and your browser and you're already good to go.

### Software Tools
---

You can either install any of these software to help you get started on your journey to develop your web applications.

My personal favorite is **VSCode** because you can install plugins to make things faster.

Don't be afraid to explore, it's part of life.

* Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v7.7.html)
* VSCode (https://code.visualstudio.com/Download)

#### VSCode Web Development Plugins (Optional)

If you opted for **VSCode**, here are some of the plugins that I find particularly useful for this course:
